A game that involves a snake and its food.



Challenge
---------

Challenges are the heart of any game. It is the kind of challenges provided to
the players, that often decides the quality and popularity of a game. The
challenge in a standard snake game is to score the highest number of points,
where the snake moves at a particular speed, and grows by a small amount by each
food taken.

Good challenge. But, we need to be innovative. We should provide another set of
challenges that are sufficient enough to keep the player engaged in the
game-play. Below is an effort into the explorartion of possible challenges we
wish to introduce into this game.
